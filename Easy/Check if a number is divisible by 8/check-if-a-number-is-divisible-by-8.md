## Summary
This code defines a function named `DivisibleByEight` that takes a string as input and checks if the last three digits of the string form a number that is divisible by 8. If the length of the string is less than 3, it adds leading zeros to make the length equal to 3. It then extracts the last three digits of the string and converts them into a number. Finally, it checks if the number is divisible by 8 and returns 1 if it is, otherwise it returns -1.

## Example Usage
```cpp
Solution obj;
string input = "123456";
int result = obj.DivisibleByEight(input);
// result = -1
```

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `s` (string): The input string.
___
### Flow
1. Calculate the length of the input string `s`.
2. If the length of `s` is less than 3, add leading zeros to `s` until its length becomes 3.
3. Initialize a variable `number` to 0.
4. Extract the last three digits of `s` and convert them into a number by subtracting the ASCII value of '0' from each digit and multiplying it by the appropriate power of 10.
5. Check if the number is divisible by 8.
6. If the number is divisible by 8, return 1. Otherwise, return -1.
___
### Outputs
- `1` if the last three digits of the input string form a number that is divisible by 8.
- `-1` if the last three digits of the input string form a number that is not divisible by 8.
